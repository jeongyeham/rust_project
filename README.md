# Rust Project

Welcome to my **Rust Learning Project**! This project is a result of following an engaging Rust tutorial taught by a Microsoft MVP on Bilibili. It documents my learning journey and showcases features implemented to demonstrate Rust's power and elegance.

> **Rust**: A modern systems programming language with high performance, zero-cost abstractions, memory safety, and a rich ecosystem.
