# Rust Project

Welcome to my **Rust Learning Project**! This project is a result of following an engaging Rust tutorial taught by a Microsoft MVP on Bilibili. It documents my learning journey and showcases features implemented to demonstrate Rust's power and elegance.

> **Rust**: A modern systems programming language with high performance, zero-cost abstractions, memory safety, and a rich ecosystem.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: Efficient memory management with an ownership system that ensures no runtime overhead.
- **Strong Type Checking**: Prevents common errors like data races and dangling references at compile time.
- **Modern Syntax**: Enhances the development experience with pattern matching, closures, and a comprehensive standard library.

## 📚 Learning Content

This project covers foundational to advanced Rust topics:

### 🛠 Basic Syntax and Data Types
- **Variable Binding & Mutability**: Control over variable reassignment.
- **Ownership Rules**: Core concept for memory management.

### 🔑 Ownership and Borrowing
- **References & Borrowing**: Safely referencing data without ownership transfer.
- **Lifetimes**: Managing data scope and avoiding dangling references.

### 🏛 Structs and Enums
- **Custom Data Types**: Defining structured types for better code organization.
- **Pattern Matching with `match`**: Elegant handling of complex control flows.

### ⚠️ Error Handling
- **`Result` and `Option` Enums**: Recoverable and unrecoverable error handling with clarity.

### 🔄 Concurrent Programming
- **Multithreading**: Creating threads with `std::thread`.
- **Data Sharing**: Using `Mutex` and `Arc` for safe concurrency.
